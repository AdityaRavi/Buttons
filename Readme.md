# Buttons

The Buttons extension for DataTables provides a common set of options, API methods and styling to display buttons on a page that will interact with a DataTable. Modules are also provided for data export, printing and column visibility control.


## Multi-row header and footer export

This branch is a prototype demonstrating multiple header and footer row export for all export types (Copy, CSV, Excel, PDF and Print). However, there are important limitations which is why it has not been merged into master:

* Column visibility is not supported
* `colspan` and `rowspan` are not supported in the header or footer.

This branch is _not_ supported - it is an experimental branch only.
